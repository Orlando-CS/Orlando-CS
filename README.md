### 🍀 About Me
I'm currently working at **Skywork AI** as a Research Engineer. My primary focus is on advancing the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Multimodal Language Models**, and **End-to-End Agent Systems**.

I entered the large model industry in 2023, gaining comprehensive experience across the entire pipeline of LLM/MLLM pre-training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). I have an in-depth understanding of the nuances at each stage and remain continually amazed by the rapid evolution of this industry. 

Prior to this, I was responsible for recommendation system at a leading social media.


### ⚡️ Key Interests
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Exploring the capabilities and applications of LLMs in various domains.
- **Multimodal Language Models**: Working on models that can understand and generate content across multiple modalities (text, image, audio, etc.).
- **Agent & Operator Systems**: Developing intelligent agents that can operate autonomously and efficiently in complex environments.
