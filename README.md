## About Me

I am a **Research Engineer and Tech Lead at Skywork AI**, working on **large-scale language models (LLMs)**, **multimodal foundation models (MLLMs)**, and **end-to-end agent systems**.

Since entering the foundation model field in **2023**, I have been deeply involved in the **full lifecycle of modern LLM/MLLM development**, including **pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), alignment, evaluation, and deployment**. My work focuses on bridging **cutting-edge research** with **scalable, production-ready systems**.

I was deeply involved in **large-scale recommendation systems** at RED before the era of LLM.
