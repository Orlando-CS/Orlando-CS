## 🍀 About Me

Hi, I’m **Peiyu Wang (王沛雨)**, a **Research Engineer and Tech Lead at Skywork AI**.

My primary focus is advancing **Artificial Intelligence**, particularly in:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs)**
- **End-to-End Agent & Operator Systems**

I entered the large model industry in **2023** and have gained hands-on experience across the **entire LLM/MLLM pipeline**, including:

- Large-scale **pre-training**
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and alignment

I have a deep understanding of the nuances at each stage and remain continually amazed by the rapid evolution of this field.

Prior to this, I worked on **recommendation systems at a leading social media platform**, focusing on large-scale user modeling and ranking systems.
